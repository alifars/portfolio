- ### Machine Learning

	- [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢ Udemy course](https://github.com/alifars/portfolio/tree/master/%20Regression/Simple%20Linear%20Regression): a complete course in machine learning, I solved all the problems 
	  *   data preprocessing
	  *   Regression
	

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [iWordSense](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/3-Way%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Tweets.ipynb): a collection of python scripts that I wrote for my master thesis with the basic theme of word sense disambiguation. The actual title is "sense tagging a persian corpus". it includes the data preparation and supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised modules.
